        <p>We exercise utmost care and the highest security standards to protect against unauthorized access to your
            personal data. The processing of personal data on our website <a
                href="index.html">https://www.TEAM-8A.com</a> and in JustWatch apps occurs in
            compliance with the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
        <p><strong>Controller Entity</strong></p>
        <p>Controller as defined by the GDPR:</p>
        <p>JustWatch GmbH
            Saarbrücker Strasse 38
            DE - 10405 Berlin</p>
        <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@team8a.com">privacy@team8a.com</a> for questions concerning
            the collection, processing and use of your
            personal data, along with requests for access to, rectification, blocking or erasure of data.</p>
        <p><strong>About Team-8A:</strong></p>
        <p>Our business involves providing you with suggestions on the best movies according to your personal taste,
            and showing you where you can view them.</p>
        <p>What we do: In order to customize your experiences, we collect, process and storage your interactions
            with our website and app. In general, all of your data is collected in an anonymized and pseudonymized
            form, and we may collect your personal data, however, for explicitly defined applications. Subject to
            your consent, we process some data with the help of third parties. Please read further to obtain
            additional details on this.</p>
        <p>What we do not do: We never collect sensitive information such as financial or health data. We never
            create profiles with legal ramifications pursuant to Article 22 of the GDPR. We never sell information
            on the user level (e.g. &quot;Which movie did a particular user click on?&quot;), unless this occurs in
            an aggregated form (&quot;Which movies are popular among users?&quot;).</p>
        <p><strong>About your data:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We collect data from you and about you.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Why we collect data.</strong></p>
        <p>We use tracking technologies for many reasons:</p>
        <p>To gain a better understanding of our audience, our customers, our website visitors and their respective
            interests.</p>
        <p>To identify new visitors to our websites and apps, in addition to previous customers.</p>
        <p>To create a profile based on your taste in movies, by means of which we are able to provide you with
            recommendations responding to your personal taste in movies and your consumer preferences.</p>
        <p>To send you customized or interest-based advertising optimized for your profile. These ads may be
            displayed both on JustWatch and on other websites you visit (with help of retargeting technology).</p>
        <p><strong>Types of data we collect</strong></p>
        <p>Contact information. For example, we may collect your e-mail address if you register via e-mail for an
            account or to receive our e-mails or to provide feedback on our forms.</p>
        <p>Information that you transmit or post publicly. For example, we collect information that you post in a
            public area on our website. We also collect information if you take part in a survey.</p>
        <p>Demographic information. We may collect your zip code in order to assist you in finding movie theaters
            relevant to you.</p>
        <p>We passively collect information on your browsing history on JustWatch. We use unique browser cookies and
            web beacons in order to identify your browser by pseudonym.</p>
        <p>We may receive a limited amount of information on you from third parties. Examples of this are your
            profile ID and information to which you have allowed access via a particular registration provider
            during registration. From some partner tracking networks, we may also receive information on
            entertainment purchases that you have made via a link originating from JustWatch.</p>
        <p>Other information. If you use our website, we may also collect information on your IP address and the
            browser you are using. We may look at the site from where you came or which websites you visit when you
            leave us. If you use our mobile app, we may identify your GPS location, subject to your additional
            consent. We might look at how often you use the app and where you downloaded it.</p>
        <p><strong>How we store and process your data</strong></p>
        <p>We process and store your data in high security data centers within the EU, operated by Amazon Web
            Services and the Google Cloud Platform. These data centers are secured and certified according to the
            highest standards (minimum ISO 27001, 27017, 27018, EU Privacy Shield and standard contractual clauses)
            and protected through signed data protection addenda.</p>
        <p>All information provided is encrypted both during transmission (TLS) and at rest. Employee access to
            personal information is limited and validated.</p>
        <p>The processing and storage of information that is possibly personally identifiable is kept to a minimum
            required for operating the service (for example: your mobile GPS location is rounded off to the nearest
            100 meters before our systems are requested to find movie theaters near you). Where required, this type
            of information is subject to access control, strict retention and pseudonymization.</p>
        <p>We retain personal data as long as is required or relevant for the practices described in this Policy,
            however no longer than for a total of 50 months. After this period, all your data is automatically
            erased if you are no longer active on JustWatch, unless retention of your data is mandated by law.</p>
        <p>We retain your data with the highest standard of currently available security processes and technologies;
            the Internet itself, however, is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our websites will
            be completely secure. We recommend that you exercise caution in the use of the Internet. This includes
            never sharing your passwords with others.</p>
        <p><strong>Concerning third parties and advertising:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We may provide information to third parties.</strong></p>
        <p>We will share information with our business partners to whom you have consented. In particular, we share
            data on the use of the website with social media platforms such as YouTube or Facebook to be able to
            show you relevant ads for your taste in movies. We track user data on our website and our apps via
            Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>We forward information if we are of the opinion that we are required to do so in order to comply with
            laws or to protect ourselves. For example, we forward information in response to a court order or a
            subpoena. We may also forward data upon request of government agencies or investigative entities. We may
            forward information if we are conducting investigations into potential fraud.</p>
        <p>We may forward information to any successor of our entire business or any part thereof. For example, if
            part of our business should be sold, we may forward our customer list in the course of this transaction.
        </p>
        <p>We instruct all third parties or demand of them within the statutory framework to destroy their data
            after 50 months if you do not remain active on JustWatch.</p>
        <p>We may forward information for other reasons which we describe to you at that time and place.</p>
        <p><strong>We may also link to other websites or offer third-party services on our website, over which we
                have no influence.</strong></p>
        <p>Our website and apps may also contain links to ads of third-party providers or other content using their
            own cookies or tracking technologies.</p>
        <p><strong>We engage in interest-based advertising.</strong></p>
        <p>We may place interest-based advertising with personal and other information collected over time across
            several websites or other platforms. This may encompass apps as well. These ads are placed on websites
            or apps. They may also be delivered in e-mails. Interest-based advertising or &quot;online
            behavior-based advertising&quot; encompasses ads delivered to you after you leave our website, inviting
            you to return to our site. They also encompass ads that we consider relevant to you based upon your
            purchasing habits or your online activities.</p>
        <p><strong>How do we collect relevant information for interest-based advertising?</strong></p>
        <p>In order to decide what is relevant to you, we may examine the history of your movie interactions and
            purchases and collect certain mobile unique operating system IDs or your browser behavior. We could
            review these activities on our own platforms or on platforms of other providers. This information is
            collected with the tracking tools described above. We work with third parties to collect this
            information. These third parties may link your name or your e-mail address with other information
            collected by them. This may involve previous past purchases made off-line or online. In addition, it may
            also include online use information.</p>
        <p><strong>Concerning your rights and options:</strong></p>
        <p>You have certain options with respect to disclosure and marketing.</p>
        <p>You may unsubscribe to our marketing e-mails and push notifications. In order to unsubscribe to our
            advertising e-mails, follow the instructions in the advertising messages that you receive from us. And
            don&#39;t worry – even if you opt out of marketing messages, we will continue to send you transaction
            messages. These include responses to your questions or information regarding your account. You can
            manage cookies and tracking tools.</p>
        <p><strong>Here is how you manage tracking technologies and are able to delete cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>You can manage certain tracking tools. In many browsers, you can delete or reject cookies. How you are
            able to do this depends on the type of cookie. You can set up your browser to reject cookies – click
            here to learn how you can administer and manage your cookies. You can manage certain tracking tools on
            your mobile devices. These options are dependent upon the services of third-party operating system
            providers and are subject to their privacy policies; they are not dependent upon any services of
            JustWatch and are also not subject to the JustWatch privacy policy. <strong>NOTICE:</strong> If you
            configure your computer to block cookies, it is possible you may not be able to access certain functions
            of our website or on the icon bar. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking activities
            described here will be ended. The decisions you make are both browser- and device-specific.</p>
        <p>For simplicity&#39;s sake, you will find instructions here that will possibly work on your mobile device;
            please observe, however, that the settings functions may vary depending upon the device.</p>
        <p><strong>Google Android</strong></p>
        <p>Devices with Google Play Services 4.0 and higher use the Google Android Advertising ID (AAID). Additional
            information for limiting ad tracking with help of this ID:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the Google settings app on your device</li>
            <li>Select Advertising</li>
            <li>Select Deactivate interest-based ads</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Apple iOS</strong></p>
        <p>Devices running on iOS 6 or higher use the Apple Advertising Identifier (IDFA). Additional information
            for limiting ad tracking with help of this ID:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the settings app on your device</li>
            <li>Select Privacy</li>
            <li>Select Advertising</li>
            <li>Select Limit ad tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You have options for the displayed interest-based ads.</strong> The self-regulation program for
            online behavioral advertising offers consumers the option of rejecting the recording and use of their
            online behavior for advertising purposes. If you would like to do this, visit this website. The
            decisions you make are both browser- and device-specific. Some web browsers offer a &quot;do not
            track&quot; function. With this function, you can inform the websites visited by you that you do not
            wish for your online activities to be tracked. These functions are still not standard for all browsers.
            Our websites are currently not set up to respond to these signals.</p>
